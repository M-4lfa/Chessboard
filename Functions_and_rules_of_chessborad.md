# Chess Rules and Guidelines

## Board Setup
1. The chessboard consists of 64 squares in an 8x8 grid.
2. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
3. The pieces are set up in two rows facing each other. The back row, from left to right, has rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook.
4. The front row is filled with pawns.

## Object of the Game
The main objective is to checkmate the opponent's king. This means the king is in a position to be captured ("in check") and there is no way to move out of capture ("checkmate").

## Movement of Pieces

### 1. King
- Moves one square in any direction.

### 2. Queen
- Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.

### 3. Rook
- Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.

### 4. Bishop
- Moves diagonally any number of squares.

### 5. Knight
- Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.

### 6. Pawn
- Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.
- On its first move, a pawn has the option to move forward two squares.
- Pawns can promote to any other piece upon reaching the eighth rank.

## Special Moves

### 1. Castling
- Involves the king and one of the rooks.
- The king moves two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king.
- Conditions: Neither piece involved has moved before, there are no pieces between them, and the king is not in check.

### 2. En Passant
- A pawn capturing move.
- If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, the opponent can capture the pawn "en passant" on the next move.

### 3. Pawn Promotion
- When a pawn reaches the eighth rank, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).

## Rules

1. Players take turns making one move at a time.
2. No piece can move through other pieces (except for the knight, which jumps over them).
3. If a player's king is in a position to be captured, it is in "check." The player must make a move to remove the check.
4. If there is no legal move to remove check, it is "checkmate," and the game ends.
5. Stalemate occurs if a player has no legal moves but is not in check. The game is a draw.
6. Draws can also occur through insufficient material or the 50-move rule (no captures or pawn moves in the last 50 moves).

## Additional Notes
- The game can also end in a draw by mutual agreement.
